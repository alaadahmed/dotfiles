;; C-i is used in Vim as counterpart to C-o for going back and forth
;; in the jump list. It also happens to be interpreted as TAB, simply
;; because terminals are a nightmare. Fortunately GUI Emacs can be
;; told to not resolve C-i to indentation by defining a function in
;; key-translation-map that returns the desired key. That way Iâ€™m
;; sending a custom <C-i> when Evil is active, in normal state and C-i
;; (as opposed to the TAB key) has been pressed, otherwise TAB is
;; passed through.
